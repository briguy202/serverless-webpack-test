# serverless-webpack-test

# Getting started
You will need to modify `./node_modules/serverless-webpack-test/index.js` line 106 to use `webpack` instead of, or in addition to, the existing `nodejs` value.

1. Run `cd {your project folder}`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `./node_modules/.bin/sls serve start`

You can add `--debug` to the end of the `sls serve start` to see more info.
